Relying on the meter of an auto or taxi is not really the best thing to do with so much tampering happening these days. There are, however, many applications available for smart phones today that can help one calculate the right fare.
So here is an android app for the same. "Prepaid/Postpaid Auto/Taxi Meter".
This app will take input information for the trip and calculates the fare.
The application opens a screen where you need to key-in the details of your journey â€“city, auto/taxi, if taxi AC/NAC and whether the user is travelling in day/night.
The app utilizes the Google Map already installed in your Android phone, and displays the map for selected city. Here the user needs to select the source and destination. Then the map gives you the best possible route (whatever Google map suggests). So there is no surprise here. Once the distance is retrieved from the Google map the fare for the trip is calculated considering all the keyed in parameters. The user interface (UI) apart from the first screen is a Google Map UI and all the Android users will be familiar with that.
